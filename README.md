# National-Highway-Traffic-Safety-Administration-NHTSA-Accident-Data-Analysis
Project Overview
This project aims to investigate how driver demographics (age, gender) relate to vehicular accidents and whether specific vehicle types are more frequently involved in crashes. By leveraging NHTSA accident datasets and additional data from the New York State Department of Transportation, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of accident trends based on vehicle make and driver characteristics.
