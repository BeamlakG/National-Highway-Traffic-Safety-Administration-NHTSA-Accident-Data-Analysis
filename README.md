# National-Highway-Traffic-Safety-Administration-NHTSA-Accident-Data-Analysis
Project Overview: 
This project aims to investigate how driver demographics (age, gender) relate to vehicular accidents and whether specific vehicle types are more frequently involved in crashes. By leveraging NHTSA accident datasets and additional data from the New York State Department of Transportation, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of accident trends based on vehicle make and driver characteristics.

Problem Statement:
"Which driver demographics (age, gender) are most involved in vehicular accidents, and are there correlations with specific vehicle types?"

Understanding accident patterns can help improve road safety policies, insurance risk assessments, and vehicle safety regulations.

Data Sources & Preparation:

âœ… Primary Data:
- NHTSA Datasets: Person, Accident, and Vehicle data
- New York State Vehicle Registration Data

âœ… Data Cleaning & Processing:
- Filtered unknown, missing, or incorrect values
- Segmented age groups into 10-year intervals
- Merged vehicle accident records with statewide vehicle population data to standardize accident rates

âœ… Created a New Standardized Dataset:
- Contained State, Car Make, Total Vehicle Count, and Fatality Cases

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings & Insights:
- Age Group 20-29 has the highest accident involvement.
- Motorcycles (Kawasaki, Yamaha, Suzuki, Freightliner) have higher accident rates, indicating increased risk.
- Car brands like Toyota, Honda, and Ford have high accident counts but lower accident rates when considering population size.
- Motorcycles are driven more by younger individuals, except for Harley Davidson, which is popular among older riders.

ðŸš— Impact of This Analysis

- Public Awareness: Helps drivers understand accident risks based on vehicle type and demographics.
- Policy & Insurance Recommendations: Insurers and policymakers can use this data to adjust risk assessments.
- Road Safety Improvements: Highlights areas where awareness campaigns or vehicle safety enhancements are needed.
