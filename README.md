# National-Highway-Traffic-Safety-Administration-NHTSA-Accident-Data-Analysis
Project Overview: 
This project aims to investigate how driver demographics (age, gender) relate to vehicular accidents and whether specific vehicle types are more frequently involved in crashes. By leveraging NHTSA accident datasets and additional data from the New York State Department of Transportation, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of accident trends based on vehicle make and driver characteristics.

Problem Statement:
"Which driver demographics (age, gender) are most involved in vehicular accidents, and are there correlations with specific vehicle types?"

Understanding accident patterns can help improve road safety policies, insurance risk assessments, and vehicle safety regulations.
